# Measuring unemployment {background-color="#62259D"}

## Measuring unemployment

<br>

As of August 2024, the U.S. [civilian unemployment rate]{.hi-slate} is of [4.2%]{.note}.

. . . 

<br><br>

  - How do you [interpret]{.note} this statistic?


## Measuring unemployment

<br>

[Adding]{.hi-blue} to the previous question, what about...

<br>

. . .

  - Relating these [4.2%]{.note} with [GDP]{.hi-orange}?
  
. . .

  - Relating these [4.2%]{.note} with those [employed]{.hi-slate}? 
  
. . .

  - And why should one [care]{.hi-pink} about these [4.2%]{.note} at all? 


## Measuring unemployment

[[**HOW**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

. . .


[Q]{.note}: How is unemployment [measured]{.note}?

. . .

[A]{.note}: [Current Population Survey]{.hi-slate} (CPS), every month since 1940. 

. . .

  - 60,000 [eligible]{.note} households;
  
. . .

  - 1/4 of households [changed]{.note} every month;
  
. . .

  - Household leaves the sample after [4]{.note} consecutive months, coming back after [8]{.note} months;
  
. . .

  - [Specific]{.note} set of questions.


## Measuring unemployment

[[**WHO**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

. . .

[Q]{.note}: What is the [scope]{.note} of the CPS?

. . .

[A]{.note}: The [civilian non-institutional population]{.note}.

  - Persons [16]{.note} years or older who do not live in [institutions]{.hi-slate}.

. . .

[Q]{.note}: Who is considered [unemployed]{.note}?

. . .

[A]{.note}: Those who were [not employed]{.note} during the reference week, but were available to work, and had made specific [efforts]{.note} to find employment sometime in the [four-week period]{.note} ending with the reference week.


## Measuring unemployment

[[**WHO**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

[Q]{.note}: Who is considered [employed]{.note}?

. . .

[A]{.note}: Those who did any work [for pay or profit]{.note} during the week before they are surveyed or who worked for [15]{.note} hours or more in a family business.


. . .

<br>

[Employed]{.hi-purple} and [unemployed]{.hi-pink} individuals make up the [labor force]{.note}.

## Measuring unemployment

[[**WHERE**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

[Q]{.note}: So [where]{.note} does the official [unemployment statistic]{.note} come from?

. . .

[A]{.note}: The [civilian unemployment rate]{.note} is obtained by:

$$
\text{Unemployment rate} = \dfrac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor force}} \times 100
$$

. . .

<br>

Thus we [formally]{.hi-green} define the [unemployment rate]{.note} as the *percentage of the labor force made up of people who do not have paid jobs but are immediately available and actively looking for paid jobs*.


## Measuring unemployment

<br><br>

[Q]{.note}: Who is considered [not in the labor force]{.note}?

. . .

[A]{.note}: Those who do not meet the [criteria]{.note} to be considered [neither]{.note} employed nor unemployed.

. . .

  - Examples?


## Measuring unemployment

<br><br>

[Q]{.note}: What about [overlaps]{.note}?

. . .

[A]{.note}: A [system of priorities]{.note} is used to determine one's status:

  - Labor force activities take [precedence]{.note} over non-labor force activities;
  - Working or having a job takes [precedence]{.note} over looking for work.

## Measuring unemployment

Lastly, one should not [ignore]{.hi-red} those who might want a job but have [given up]{.note} looking for them.

. . .

  - Thus, official unemployment statistics may [underestimate]{.hi-pink} people's [desires]{.note} for a paid job.


. . .


In order to account for these individuals, the CPS includes questions to categorize [marginally attached workers]{.hi-purple}.

. . .

> *[Marginally attached workers]{.hi-purple} are individuals who want employment and have looked for work in the past 12 months but not in the past 4 weeks*.

. . .

Within this latter category, there might be so-called [discouraged workers]{.hi}:

  - Individuals who want employment but have [given up]{.note} looking because they believe that there are no jobs available for them.
