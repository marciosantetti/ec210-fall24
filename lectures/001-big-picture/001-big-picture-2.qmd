# Quick review

## Quick review

Measured by what each economic sector [spends]{.hi}, [Gross Domestic Product]{.hi-green} (GDP) can be defined by:

$$
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X-M)
$$

. . .

<br>

A few questions:

  - Examples of [Consumption]{.note} (*C*) expenditures?
  
  - What do we mean by [Investment]{.note} (*I*)?
  
  - Examples of [Government]{.note} spending?
  
  - How do we call [*(X -M)*]{.note}?

# The income approach {background-color="#62259D"}

## The income approach

After seeing how GDP can be computed via the [spending approach]{.hi-blue}, one can get the same results by:

  - Adding up all [incomes]{.hi}, rather than *outputs*.
  
. . .

The starting point is a measure known as [National Income]{.hi-orange} (NI).

. . .

  - It is the sum of the incomes earned by each (macro)economic [sector]{.hi-slate}, except for the *foreign* sector.
  
. . .

What are the incomes earned by:

  - [Households]{.note}?
  - [Firms]{.note}?
  - [Government]{.note}?




## The income approach

[NI]{.hi-orange}, however, will **not** be equal to the [GDP]{.hi-slate} obtained by the [spending]{.hi-red} approach.

. . .

In other terms:

$$
\text{Wages} + \text{Profits} + \text{Rents} + \text{Interest} + \text{Net Taxes} \neq C + I + G + (X-M)
$$

. . .

In order to make them equal:

  - Add incomes from [*foreign*]{.note} production;
  - Add the [*wear-and-tear*]{.note} of structures, equipment, software,...


. . .

With that, we arrive at a country's [Gross Domestic Income]{.hi-orange} (GDI).

## The income approach  

A country's [Gross Domestic Income]{.hi-orange} (GDI) is defined by:

  > *The total amount of money earned by a nationâ€™s people and its businesses*.
  
. . .

<br>

[Q]{.note}: What is the [GDI]{.hi-purple} of the U.S. economy?

. . .

[A]{.note}: As of the second quarter of 2024 (2024Q2), its GDI is of US$ [27.88 trillion]{.note}.

. . .

[Q]{.note}: But wasn't the U.S. GDP around US$ [28 trillion]{.note}?

. . .

[A]{.note}: Yes, but different data [*sources*]{.orange} yield different [*results*]{.orange}.

  - [Statistical discrepancy]{.note}.
  

## The income approach

As an [example]{.hi}, suppose a simple economy producing a *single* product: bread.

It is produced in [three]{.hi-purple} stages:

. . .

  1. Wheat is grown, harvested, and sold for $1 by a
farmer to a miller (for simplification, assume the
wheat is produced using *no* intermediate goods);

  2. The wheat is used by a miller to produce flour,
which is sold for $3; and

  3. The flour is used by a baker to produce bread,
which is sold to a consumer for $7.

. . .

<br>

[Q1]{.note}: What is this economy's [Gross Domestic Income]{.note}?

[Q2]{.note}: What is this economy's [Gross Domestic Product]{.note}?

## Breaking down GDP

<br>

What do we mean by:

<br>

  - [Gross]{.note}?
  
  - [Domestic]{.note}?
  
  - [Product]{.note}?
  
## GDP by expenditure

# Quick practice

## Quick practice

Suppose you are given the following data (in US$ billions):

  - *Sales of durable goods*: $ 1,035
  - *Nonresidential investment expenditures*: $ 1,388.80
  - *Federal Government expenditures*: $ 1,144.80
  - *Changes in business inventories*: $ -120.90
  - *Exports*: $ 1,564.20
  - *Services*: $ 6,833.90
  - *Sales of nondurable goods*: $ 2,220.20
  - *State and local government spending*: $ 1,786.90
  - *Imports*: $ 1,956.60
  - *Residential investment*: $ 361.00

. . .

Compute *(a)* each [aggregate expenditure]{.hi} and *(b)* its [total value]{.hi-slate}.
