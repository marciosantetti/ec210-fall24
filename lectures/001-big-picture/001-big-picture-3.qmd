## GDP: Shapes and forms

Suppose a "*toy*" economy, with [no]{.hi-purple} government and [no]{.hi-purple} interactions with the foreign sector, that only produces [apples]{.hi-red}:

<br>

| YEAR | QUANTITY SOLD | CURRENT PRICE ($)
|------|--------------:|-------------:|
| 2015 |       200     |     1.00 
| 2016 |       200     |     1.50 
| 2017 |       230     |     1.30     |

: A "Toy" economy {tbl-colwidths="[10,20,22]"}

. . .

<br>

  - Let us compute its [GDP]{.note} for each [year]{.hi}.
  


## GDP: Shapes and forms

Simply looking at [current (market)]{.hi-orange} prices can be [misleading]{.hi-slate}.

. . .

  - [Why]{.note}?
  
. . .

<br>

  - [Inflation]{.hi-red} creates [distortions]{.hi-slate} in assessing whether [production/income]{.note} have actually changed or not over time.
  
. . .

<br>

> *[Inflation]{.hi-red} is a sustained increase in an economy's price level.*


## GDP: Shapes and forms

To that end, we introduce an important [distinction]{.hi-purple}:

  - [Nominal]{.hi-green} GDP: the dollar value of all final goods and services produced in a year [in that yearâ€™s prices]{.note};
  
  - [Real]{.hi-orange} GDP: a measure reflecting the [actual value]{.note} of goods and services produced, by [removing the effect of changes in prices]{.orange} over time.


. . .

<br>

When analyzing economic indicators, we usually pay attention to [real]{.hi-blue} measures.
