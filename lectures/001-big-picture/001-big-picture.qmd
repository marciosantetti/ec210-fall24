## The big picture

<br>

[Macroeconomics]{.hi} gravitates around [three]{.hi-purple} main elements:

. . .

  - A measure of [production/income]{.note};
  
. . .

  - A measure for [labor markets]{.note};
  
. . .

  - A measure for the [price level]{.note}.


## The big picture


As social scientists, economists make sense of [fuzzy]{.note} information by using [aggregate<sup>1</sup> statistics<sup>2</sup>]{.hi-green}.

. . .

  <sup>1</sup> *[Aggregate]{.green}: sum.*
  
. . .

  <sup>2</sup> *[Statistic]{.green}: a measure describing a population of interest. Generally derived from samples.*


. . .

<br>

We will study [different]{.blue} economic statistics describing the same element, with the [most popular]{.hi-purple} ones being:

. . .

  - The **Gross Domestic Product** (GDP) for production/income;
  
  - The **unemployment rate** for labor markets;
  
  - The **Consumer Price Index** (CPI) for the price level.



## The big picture

<br><br>

Let us start with the [Gross Domestic Product]{.hi} (GDP), the *leading* measure of a country's overall economic *performance* and *size.*

## The size of an economy

Consider the following activities for a "toy" economy in 2023:

| ACTIVITY | QUANTITY| PRICE
|----------|---------:|-------:|
| New cars    | 5    |   30     |
| Amazon stocks     |  10   |  10      |
| Neighbor babysitting   | 7    |   3     |
| Imported beer/wine   | 8    |    2    |
| Used cars   | 6    |        |25
| Machine maintenance   | 4    |   8     |
| Car engines (for new cars)   | 2    |    9    |
| Drug trafficking   | 10    |   10     |
| Snow plowing   | 15    |    5    |

[Q]{.note}: What is the [size]{.hi-purple} of the U.S. economy?

. . .

[A]{.note}: As of the second quarter of 2024 (2024Q2), its size, measured by its [Gross Domestic Product]{.hi-green} (GDP), is of US$ [28.65 trillion]{.note}.

. . .

<br>

  - What does that mean?


## The size of an economy

According to the [U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis]{.purple}:

  - A country's [Gross Domestic Product]{.hi-green} (GDP) is a measure of the *total market value of final goods and services newly produced within a country’s borders over a period of time (usually one year)*.

. . .

<br>

Lots of things to make sense of:

. . .

  - *Market value*?
  
  - *Final goods and services*?
  
  - *Within a country's borders*?


## The size of an economy


<br>

As described by the economist [*Diane Coyle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Coyle):


> *"Everything from nails to toothbrushes, tractors, shoes, haircuts, management consultancy, street cleaning, yoga teaching, plates, bandages, books, and the millions of other services and products in the economy."*

# Measuring GDP {background-color="#62259D"}

## Measuring GDP

The federal agency responsible for compiling data and computing GDP in the United States is the [*Bureau of Economic Analysis*](https://www.bea.gov/).

. . .

In order to make GDP accounting as standardized and comparable as possible across different countries, agencies adopt similar [national income accounting]{.hi-purple} conventions.

. . .

In the U.S., this is done by the [National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)]{.hi-orange}.

. . .

The first important convention concerns [*who*]{.hi} matters for macroeconomic analysis.

. . .

These are:

  - Households;
  - Businesses (firms);
  - Governments;
  - The foreign sector.



## Measuring GDP

<br>

[Households]{.hi-blue} and [businesses]{.hi-red} form the [private]{.hi-purple} sector.

. . .

  - Businesses include for-profit firms and certain business-serving nonprofit organizations (e.g., chambers of commerce).
  
. . .

  - Other nonprofit organizations (universities, hospitals, museums, unions, charities) are not considered as businesses by the BEA.
  



## Measuring GDP

<br>

[Governments]{.hi-blue} are part of the [public]{.hi-orange} sector.

. . .

It includes all *three* instances of government (federal, state, local).

## Measuring GDP

<br>

[The rest of the world]{.hi-blue} comprehends the *foreign sector*.

. . .

It includes all *entities*—household, nonprofit, business, or government—located outside the borders of the country one is analyzing.


## Measuring GDP

After being introduced to the main [macroeconomic agents]{.hi-green}, we can look more closely to how GDP is calculated.

. . .

There are a few different [approaches]{.hi-purple}:

. . .

  - The [spending]{.hi} approach;
  
  - The [income]{.hi-slate} approach;
  
  - The [value-added]{.hi-orange} approach.
  
. . .

<br>

Let us talk about these.


## Measuring GDP




## Measuring GDP


[The spending approach]{.note}:


$$
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$

<br>

. . .

From the perspective of what each agent [spends on goods and services]{.hi-slate} in a given period, GDP calculated by the [spending approach]{.note} is composed of:


. . .

  - Aggregate [consumption]{.hi} (*C*);
  
  - Aggregate private [investment]{.hi-slate} (*I*);
  
  - Aggregate [government expenditures]{.hi} (*G*);
  
  - The [trade balance]{.hi-slate} (*X - M*).


## Measuring GDP

<br>

[Aggregate consumption]{.hi} accounts for all household consumption expenditures on final goods and services.

. . .

  - Household appliances, haircuts, concert tickets, groceries,...

. . .


<br>

It usually accounts for about [2/3]{.note} of total GDP.



## Measuring GDP

<br>

[Aggregate investment]{.hi-slate} accounts for businesses purchasing new machinery, new software, new plants, as well as household residential investment.

  - It also includes changes in [*inventories*]{.red}:
  
    &rarr; *unsold* output produced in the reference year.



## Measuring GDP

<br>

[Government expenditures]{.hi} account for federal, state, and local instances consumption and investment decisions.

  - Building highways, new schools, military spending, health & education,...
  


. . .

[Note]{.note}: Unemployment and veteran benefits, as well as social security payments are **not** included. 

  &rarr; These are transfers that will likely be spent on *consumption.*



## Measuring GDP

Lastly, a country's [trade balance]{.hi} is the difference between its [Exports]{.hi-blue} (*X*) and its [Imports]{.hi-red} (*M*).

. . .

Then, a country's [net exports]{.hi-slate} (*X - M*) is the difference between *domestically* produced goods that a country sells abroad and goods and services produced *in other countries* that residents of another country purchase. 

. . .

<br>

  - What happens if a country *exports* more than it imports?
  
. . .

  - What about countries that *import* more than they export?
  

## Measuring GDP

From the [spending approach]{.hi-slate} GDP measurement:

<br>


$$
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$


<br>

- What spending is made by the *private* sector?

- By the *government* sector?

- By the *foreign* sector?
