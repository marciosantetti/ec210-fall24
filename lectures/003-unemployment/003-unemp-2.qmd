## The market for labor

<br><br>

  - In a *not-too-far* future from now, what [characteristics]{.note} will you be seeking in your job? 
  
. . .
  
<br>

  - And what will you want to [avoid]{.note}? 


## The market for labor

First, defining what [markets]{.hi} mean.

. . .

$\hspace{1cm}$ &rarr; [Market]{.note}: an [institution]{.hi-slate} that facilitates economic interactions among *buyers* and *sellers.*

. . .

<br>

However, [labor markets]{.hi-orange} are *different* from other markets in [several]{.note} ways. 


. . .

<br>

  - What is for [sale]{.note}?
  
  - What is available for [purchase]{.note}?
  
  - Do [interests]{.note} necessarily *match* between all parts involved?




## The market for labor

<br>

The [labor market]{.hi-pink} can be generally understood through [two]{.note} main [actors]{.note}:

. . .

  - [[Workers]{.note}]{.bg-grey}: Those who [supply]{.hi-purple} labor.
  
  - [[Employers]{.note}]{.bg-grey}: Those who [demand]{.hi} labor.
  
. . .

<br>

These are not [static]{.hi-blue} over time.

  - Determining [bargaining]{.hi-pink} positions.

. . .

<br><br>

$\hspace{1cm}$&rarr; Does the [behavior]{.hi-slate} of the unemployment rate relate to [economic activity]{.hi-green}?


# Unemployment & GDP {background-color="#62259D"}

## Unemployment & GDP

Unemployment tends to [rise]{.hi-pink} once a recession kicks in.

. . .

  - However, it [does not]{.hi-blue} usually start [rising]{.note} before a recession starts.
  
. . .

  - Unemployment is often considered a [lagging]{.note} variable that only moves once there are *already* other signs of economic trouble.
  
. . .

<br>

[Conversely]{.note}, unemployment tends to [decrease]{.hi} in times of economic [expansion]{.hi-green}.

. . .

<br>

This association is known as [Okun's law]{.note}.

. . .

# Types of unemployment {background-color="#62259D"}

## Types of unemployment

While the [definition]{.note} of unemployment is [unique]{.hi}, those [unemployed]{.hi-slate} differ in many aspects. (education, circumstances, industry, etc.)

. . .

<br>

Possible [explanations]{.hi-orange} for unemployment may be summarized into [three]{.hi-purple} different groups:

. . .

  1. [Frictional]{.note} unemployment;
  
  2. [Structural]{.note} unemployment;
  
  3. [Cyclical]{.note} unemployment.



## Types of unemployment

<br><br>



[Frictional]{.note} unemployment:

<br>

  - The most "normal" kind of unemployment.
  
  - Mostly *voluntary.*


## Types of unemployment

<br><br>



[Structural]{.note} unemployment:

<br>

  - Related to the [sectors]{.hi} of an economy.
  
  - Mostly *involuntary.*


## Types of unemployment

<br><br>

[Cyclical]{.note} unemployment:

<br>

  - Related to the economy's [business cycles]{.hi-green}.
  
  - Mostly *involuntary.* 
  
# Theories of unemployment  {background-color="#62259D"}

## Theories of unemployment

Regardless of the economic [scenario]{.hi-orange}, [policymakers]{.hi-slate} are always faced with *unemployment-related* [puzzles]{.note}:

<br>

  - Is a [low-unemployment]{.note} level *sustainable* for longer periods of time?
  
  - How can we deal with [involuntary]{.note} unemployment?
  
  - Will the labor market [adjust]{.note} on its own?
  
  - How can the [government]{.note} help?

. . .

. . .

  - Interrelationship between [time]{.note}, [uncertainty]{.note}, and [money]{.note}.
  
. . .

$\hspace{1cm}$ &rarr; The past is [irrevocable]{.note} and the future is [unknown]{.note}.

$\hspace{1cm}$ &rarr; Every action is predicated on [uncertainty]{.note}.

$\hspace{1cm}$ &rarr; [Money]{.note} as a *medium of exchange* and a *store of value*.

  - [Aggregate investment (*I*)]{.note} as the key component of aggregate demand.
  
. . .

  - It links [time]{.note}, [uncertainty]{.note}, and [money]{.note} dimensions.
  
. . .

  - Investment decisions based on [expected profits]{.note}.
