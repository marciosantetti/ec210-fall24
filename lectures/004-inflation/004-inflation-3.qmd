## Inflation & money

<br>

As we have seen previously, one of the main [problems]{.hi} caused by inflation is that it deteriorates the [value of money]{.hi-green}.

. . .

  - In particular, money loses its [store of value]{.note} property.
  
. . .

<br>

Time to dig deeper into [money]{.hi-green} and its role in the (macro)economy.
