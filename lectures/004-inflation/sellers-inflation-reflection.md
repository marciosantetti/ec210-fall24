The following questions are based on the [`video`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6WXKUQJ62Y&t=510s) we watched together in class. In a recent episode of the "Odd Lots" podcast (Bloomberg), economist Isabella Weber discussed the recent inflationary period in the U.S. and other countries after the COVID-19 pandemic. She has introduced a novel explanation for inflation, coined as "seller's inflation." Based on the video (we have watched about 27 minutes of it in class), reflect on the following questions:

---

**[1]** When discussing monetary policy with the purpose of controlling inflation, prof. Weber argues that workers can be "punished twice" from such a policy. Using your own words and with the content presented over the past lectures on this theme, explain how and why workers may suffer this double punishment. (10 points)

**[2]** Comment on the possibility of "buffer stocks," on commodities such as oil and grains. What would be their purpose? How would they help in preventing cost-push inflation? (10 points)

For all questions, write between 3 to 5 paragraphs. Submit a PDF file with your typed answers through Canvas. The assignment is called "Seller's inflation reflection." Points from this assignment will be put into the "Quizzes" grading group.
