## When governments step in



In times of [recession]{.hi}, solely relying on [monetary policy]{.hi-purple} to stimulate the economy may not be enough.

. . .

<br>

The usual recipe involves a [policy mix]{.note}:

  - [Monetary]{.note} +
  - [Fiscal]{.note} policies.
  
. . .



> [Fiscal]{.hi-blue} policy encompasses how governments manage their [budget]{.note}&mdash;namely what governments [spend]{.note}, how they [get]{.note} the money that they   spend, and the [effects]{.note} of these activities on GDP levels.

## When governments step in

[Fiscal]{.hi-blue} policy adds another component to [Aggregate Demand (AD)]{.note}:

<br>

$$
\text{AD} = C + I + G
$$

. . .

<br>

$$
\text{AD} = \underbrace{C + I}_{\text{private sector}} + \underbrace{G}_{\text{public sector}}
$$

. . .

<br><br>

For now, we are [ignoring]{.hi-pink} the [foreign]{.note} sector (*X - M*).

## When governments step in

<br>

Especially in periods of [high uncertainty]{.hi-red}, fiscal policy may reintroduce [stability]{.note} to economic activity and employment.

. . .

<br>

[Fiscal policy]{.hi-blue} can be implemented in [several]{.note} ways, namely:

  - Raising/lowering [government spending]{.note} (*G*);
  - Raising/lowering [taxes]{.note} (*T*);
  - Raising/lowering [transfer payments]{.note} (*TR*).
  
## When governments step in

[[**Government expenditures (G)**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

  - Infrastructure;
  - Updating electrical grid;
  - Renewable energy research.

. . .


[[**Taxes (T)**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

  - Tax cuts/increases to households and businesses.

. . .


[[**Transfer payments (TR)**]{.note}]{.bg-grey}

  - Unemployment benefits;
  - Food stamps;
  - Social security. 


## When governments step in

<br>

While [government spending]{.hi} (*G*) [directly]{.note} affects the economy, [tax]{.hi-pink} changes (*T*) and [transfer]{.hi-pink} payments (*TR*) have an [indirect]{.note} effect in the economy.

. . .

<br>

  - This happens because events such as tax cuts or transfer payments are [not]{.hi-slate} expenditures [per se]{.note}.



## When governments step in

There are [two]{.hi-red} types of fiscal policy:

. . .

  - [Expansionary]{.note};
  
  - [Contractionary.]{.note}

. . .

While [expansionary]{.note} fiscal policy aims to [stimulate]{.hi-green} the economy, [contractionary]{.note} policies lead to [lowering]{.hi-orange} the level of economic activity.

. . .

<br>

  - [Expansionary fiscal policies]{.note}: increases in government expenditures and transfer payments, tax reductions.
  
  - [Contractionary fiscal policies]{.note}: reductions in government expenditures and transfer payments, tax raises.

# The government budget {background-color="#62259D"}

## The government budget

<br>

Since fiscal policy involves changes in a government's [budget]{.hi}, the latter can be defined as:

<br><br><br>

$$
\text{Government budget} = \text{Taxes} - (\text{Government expenditures} + \text{Transfer payments})
$$



  
## The government budget

<br>

Since fiscal policy involves changes in a government's [budget]{.hi}, the latter can be defined as:

<br><br>

$$
\text{Government budget} = \underbrace{\text{Taxes}}_{\text{Revenue}} - \underbrace{(\text{Government expenditures} + \text{Transfer payments})}_{\text{Outlays}}
$$

. . .

<br><br>

  - When a government's revenues are [greater]{.hi-pink} than its outlays, it has a budget [surplus]{.note}.
  - When a government's revenues are [lower]{.hi-green} than its outlays, it has a budget [deficit]{.note}.

## The government budget

When [revenues]{.hi-orange} (i.e., taxes) are not sufficient to [cover]{.hi-green} outlays, the government [borrows]{.note} to cover the difference.

. . .

[Q:]{.note} But how do governments [finance]{.note} their debt?
  
. . .

<br>

[A:]{.note} Through the sale of [government bonds]{.hi-slate}. (in the US, treasury bonds... bought by firms, households, foreign governments)
  
. . .

> A [government bond]{.hi-blue} is an interest-bearing [security]{.note} constituting a promise to pay at a specified future time.
